Thoughts on NCL Fall 2025 Competition

My interest in cybersecurity comes from seeking a career change.  My previous career field has burned me out and I wanted to do something new but still challanging that would also require me to expand my skillsets.  So far, I have found the field interesting and and happy I have chosen to pursue it.

The CTF experience was fun and informative.  It was really interesting to actually use some of the tools I have heard about in my SANS courses, as well as get exposed to some new tools.  It was also to intesting to use knowledge I had in things like python for something cybersecurity related in a practical rather than lab environment.

Highlights for the Individual competition include getting hard level questions right in the Open-Source category.  The hard level questions involved answering questions surronding open source information maps about infrastructure.  Other participants had sabatoged the relevant info by creating accounts and posting incorrect info.  I noticed the suspicious nature of multiple timestamps since the competition started and used earlier information to correctly answer the questions.
For the Team competition, I have two highlights.  One is getting the Hard level question relating to the location of images taken correctly with the help of my team my using reason alone.  We were able to correcting guess where the pictures were taken with metadata and rational questioning, instead of the intended way of using a particular open source image reading app that finds locations based on shadows present on the image.  The other highlight is in figuring out how to manually parse a hard level log file that was using a custom binary scheme well enough to instruct ChatGPT to parse the whole thing correctly. 

Overall, participating in the competition expaneded my knowledge on cybersecurity and I enjoyed participating in it.
